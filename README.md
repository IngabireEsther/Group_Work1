## Activities Documentation

1. **Notebook Development**

   - Developed a Jupyter Notebook (`groupw.ipynb`) containing the following Python programs:
     - **Program 1:** Prompts the user to enter their name and year of birth, then calculates and displays their age based on the current year (2025).
     - **Program 2:** Asks the user to input a string and checks if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), displaying the result.
   - The notebook is designed for interactive learning and practice with user input, functions, and string manipulation in Python.
